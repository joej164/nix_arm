# nix_arm
NixOS Config to get Automatic Ripping Machine running on my server

Sets up the server, downloads docker, configures the file structure, then downloads the Docker Image and installs it on the server and sets it to auto run.

Still needs some tweaking as currently it's all in just the configuration.nix file, but worked in my virtualbox environment.
